# 🐾 Nekodop – Cat Adoption & Management Platform

**Nekodop** is a small-scale university project designed to streamline the process of cat adoption. Built entirely using **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it features both **user-facing functionality** and a basic **admin management panel**. It's powered by **SQLite** for database management, uses **Cloudinary** for image hosting, and integrates **Font Awesome** for UI icons.
